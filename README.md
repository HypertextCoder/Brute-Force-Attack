## Introduction

Brute force password cracking involves trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. This method is computationally intensive but is guaranteed to find the password given enough time and resources. This project serves as a demonstration of brute force techniques and is intended for educational purposes only.

## Features

- Cracks passwords up to 10 characters in length.
- Supports a customizable character set.
- Displays the time taken to crack the password.
- Simple and easy to understand implementation.

## Installation

To run this program, you will need Python installed on your system. Follow the instructions below to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/HypertextCoder/Brute-Force-Attack.git
   cd password-cracker
   ```

2. Install any necessary dependencies (if any).

## Usage

To use the password cracker, run the script with the following command:
```sh
python attackpass.py
```

You can customize the character set and the target password by modifying the script. Ensure that the target password is within the allowed length and character set.
